Understand your cycle time

Let us start with a basic assumption about software development. We will describe it with the OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) loop. Originally designed to keep fighter pilots from being shot out of the sky, the OODA loop is an excellent way to think about staying ahead of your competitors. You start with observing business, market, needs, current user behavior, and available telemetry data. Then you orient with the enumeration of options for what you can deliver, perhaps with experiments. Next, you decide what to pursue, and you act by delivering working software to real users. You can see all occurring in some cycle time.




Become data-informed

We recommend you use data to inform what to do in your next cycle. Many experience reports tell us that roughly one-third of the deployments will have negative business results. Approximately one-third will have positive results, and one-third will make no difference. Fail fast on effects that do not advance the business and double down on outcomes that support the business. Sometimes the approach is called pivot or persevere.

Strive for validated learning

How quickly you can fail fast or double down is determined by your cycle time. Also, in how long that loop takes, or in lean terms. Your cycle time determines how quickly you can gather feedback to determine what happens in the next loop. The feedback that you collect with each cycle should be factual, actionable data. We call it validated learning.




Shorten your cycle time

When you adopt DevOps practices:

 -  You shorten your cycle time by working in smaller batches.
 -  Using more automation.
 -  Hardening your release pipeline.
 -  Improving your telemetry.
 -  Deploying more frequently.




Optimize validated learning

The more frequently you deploy, the more you can experiment. The more opportunity you have to pivot or persevere and gain validated learning each cycle. This acceleration in validated learning is the value of the improvement. Think of it as the sum of progress that you achieve and the failures that you avoid.



Remember, the goal is to shorten cycle time. Start with the release pipeline. How long does it take to deploy a change of one line of code or configuration? Ultimately, that is the brake on your velocity.

 -  Continuous Integration drives the ongoing merging and testing of code, leading to an early finding of defects. Other benefits include less time wasted fighting merge issues and rapid feedback for development teams.




 -  Continuous Delivery of software solutions to production and testing environments helps organizations quickly fix bugs and respond to ever-changing business requirements.




 -  Version Control, usually with a Git-based Repository, enables teams worldwide to communicate effectively during daily development activities. Also, integrate with software development tools for monitoring activities such as deployments.




 -  Use Agile planning and lean project management techniques to:
     -  Plan and isolate work into sprints.
     -  Manage team capacity and help teams quickly adapt to changing business needs.
     -  A DevOps Definition of Done is working software collecting telemetry against the intended business goals.




 -  Monitoring and Logging of running applications. Including production environments for application health and customer usage. It helps organizations create a hypothesis and quickly validate or disprove strategies. Rich data is captured and stored in various logging formats.




 -  Public and Hybrid Clouds have made the impossible easy. The cloud has removed traditional bottlenecks and helped commoditize Infrastructure. You can use Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) to lift and shift your existing apps or Platform as a Service (PaaS) to gain unprecedented productivity. The cloud gives you a data center without limits.




 -  Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Enables the automation and validation of the creation and teardown of environments to help deliver secure and stable application hosting platforms.




 -  Use Microservices architecture to isolate business use cases into small reusable services that communicate via interface contracts. This architecture enables scalability and efficiency.




 -  Containers are the next evolution in virtualization. They're much more lightweight than virtual machines, allow much faster hydration, and easily configure files.




DevOps may hurt at first.

If it hurts, do it more often. Adopting new practices like going to the gym is likely to hurt first. The more you exercise the new techniques, the easier they'll become.

Like training at the gym, where you first exercise large muscles before small muscles, adopt practices that have the most significant impact. Cross-train to develop synergy.

Unless you're building an entirely new organization, one of the significant challenges with any DevOps Transformation Project is taking actions that conflict. At least in some way with ongoing business states.

The first challenge is the availability of staff. Suppose the staff members leading the transformation project are also involved in existing day-to-day work within the organization.

It will be challenging to focus on the transformation when their current role directly impacts customer outcomes.

We all know desperate situations involving customers will always win over a long-term project, like DevOps Transformations.

Another issue will be how the organization operates—implementing existing processes and procedures to support current business outcomes.

The disruption required for a true DevOps Transformation will usually challenge existing processes and procedures. Doing that is often difficult.

In the book "Beyond the Idea: How to Execute Innovation," Dr. Vijay Govindarajan and Dr. Chris Trimble noted when successful, they have researched what is involved in allowing Innovation to occur in organizations.

It has often been despite the existing organizational processes. Concluding it only works by creating a separate team to pursue the transformation.

For DevOps transformations, the separate team should be composed of staff members. Focused on and measured the transformation outcomes and not involved in the day-to-day operational work. The team might also include external experts that can fill the knowledge gaps—also helping to advise on processes that are new to the existing staff members.

Ideally, the staff members recruited should already be well-regarded throughout the organization. They should offer a broad knowledge base to think outside the box as a group.

Explore shared goals

These outcomes should include specific, measurable targets like:

 -  Reduce the time spent on fixing bugs by 60%.
 -  Reduce the time spent on unplanned work by 70%.
 -  Reduce the out-of-hours work required by staff to no more than 10% of total working time.
 -  Remove all direct patching of production systems.


> One of the aims of DevOps is to provide more excellent customer value, so outcomes should have a customer value focus.

Define timelines for goals

Measurable goals also need to have timelines. While it is easy to set longer-term goals, it is also easy to put off work when you do not require it for a while.

It is essential to have an ongoing series of short-term goals. Overall, projects should have timelines that span anywhere from a few months to a year or two in any DevOps transformation project.

Every few weeks, the improvements should be clear and measurable. Ideally, evident to the organization or its customers.

The timeline should not be too short and should always be challenging yet achievable. A review should occur after each short-term goal to help plan the next one.

There are several advantages of the shorter timelines:

 -  It is easier to change plans or priorities when necessary.
 -  The reduced delay between doing work and getting feedback helps ensure that the learnings and feedback are incorporated quickly.
 -  It is easier to keep organizational support when positive outcomes are clear.
