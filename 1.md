## Exercise Unit: Train a Simple Linear Regression Model using Azure Machine Learning to Predict Body Temperature of Dogs Based on Age

**Learning Objective:**
- Learners will be able to train a simple linear regression model using Azure Machine Learning to predict body temperature based on dogs' ages and interpret the results.

**Scenario:**
- As a data scientist at a veterinary clinic, you have been tasked with predicting the body temperature of dogs based on their ages to help veterinarians make informed decisions. You will use Azure Machine Learning to build a linear regression model that accomplishes this task.

### Task 1: Load the Dataset into Azure Machine Learning Workspace
1. **Create a new Azure Machine Learning workspace:**
   1. Follow the instructions to create a workspace in Azure Machine Learning.
   2. Navigate to the Azure Portal, select "Create a resource," and search for "Machine Learning."
   3. Provide the required information, such as workspace name, subscription, resource group, and region.
   4. Create the workspace and wait for the deployment to complete.
  
2. **Open the Azure Machine Learning Studio:**
   1. Navigate to [Azure Machine Learning Studio](https://ml.azure.com/).
   2. Sign in with your Azure credentials.

3. **Create a new pipeline in Azure Machine Learning Designer:**
   1. Select "Designer" from the left-hand navigation menu.
   2. Click on "Create a new pipeline using classic prebuilt components."
   3. Rename the pipeline to "Dog Temperature Prediction."

4. **Import the dataset:**
   1. In the left pane, select "Datasets."
   2. Click on "Create dataset" and choose "From local files."
   3. Upload the dataset containing dogs' ages and core temperatures.
   4. Drag the newly created dataset onto the pipeline canvas.

### Task 2: Visualize the Data Distribution
1. **Preview the dataset:**
   1. Right-click the dataset on the canvas and select "Preview data."
   2. Examine the columns to understand the data structure.

2. **Add a Histogram component:**
   1. In the component palette, search for "Histogram."
   2. Drag the Histogram component onto the canvas and connect it to the dataset.
   3. Configure the Histogram component to plot the age distribution.
   4. Add another Histogram component to visualize the core temperature distribution.
   5. Run the pipeline to generate the histograms.

### Task 3: Plot the Relationship Between Features and Labels
1. **Add a Scatter Plot component:**
   1. Search for "Scatter Plot" in the component palette.
   2. Drag the Scatter Plot component onto the canvas and connect it to the dataset.
   3. Configure the Scatter Plot to plot age (X-axis) against core temperature (Y-axis).
   4. Run the pipeline to generate the scatter plot.

### Task 4: Fit a Simple Linear Regression Model
1. **Prepare the data:**
   1. Search for "Select Columns in Dataset" component.
   2. Drag it onto the canvas and connect it to the dataset.
   3. Select the columns for age and core temperature.
   
2. **Split the data:**
   1. Search for "Split Data" component.
   2. Drag it onto the canvas and connect it to the Select Columns in Dataset component.
   3. Configure the component to split the data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.

3. **Train the model:**
   1. Search for "Linear Regression" component.
   2. Drag it onto the canvas.
   3. Search for "Train Model" component.
   4. Drag it onto the canvas and connect it to the Linear Regression component and the training data.
   5. Configure the Train Model component to use age as the feature and core temperature as the label.
   6. Run the pipeline to train the model.

### Task 5: Interpret the Model Parameters
1. **Evaluate the model:**
   1. Search for "Score Model" component.
   2. Drag it onto the canvas and connect it to the trained model and the testing data.
   3. Search for "Evaluate Model" component.
   4. Drag it onto the canvas and connect it to the Score Model component.
   5. Run the pipeline to evaluate the model's performance.

2. **Interpret the results:**
   1. Right-click on the Evaluate Model component and select "Preview data > Evaluation results."
   2. Examine the model's intercept and slope parameters.
   3. Understand how these parameters influence the prediction of body temperature based on age.

### Task 6: Make Predictions and Compare Results
1. **Use the model to make predictions:**
   1. Add a "Web Service Input" component to the canvas.
   2. Connect it to the trained model.
   3. Add a "Web Service Output" component to capture the predictions.
   4. Run the pipeline to deploy the model.

2. **Test the deployed model:**
   1. Navigate to the Endpoints section in the Azure Machine Learning Studio.
   2. Select the deployed endpoint and use the provided REST API to make predictions for different ages.
   3. Compare the predictions with the plotted trendline from the scatter plot.

**Practical Tasks:**
1. Load a new dataset with additional dog ages and predict their body temperatures using the trained model.
2. Create an interactive web app using Streamlit to input dog ages and display predicted body temperatures.

**Checkpoints:**
1. **Question:** What is the purpose of splitting the data into training and testing sets?
   - **Answer:** Splitting the data allows us to train the model on one portion and validate its performance on another, ensuring the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
2. **Task:** Preview the evaluation results and note the mean absolute error (MAE) of the model.
